      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I build AI powered apps. I've built a bunch of front-end interfaces for mock NFT projects as well using React and Solidity. Who are you? Is there anything I can help you with?</p>
      <p>I code because I love to build. When I'm building it's like I step outside of time. I'm also an excellent communicator. You know when you call a call centre and an automated message says "Your call may be monitored for quality and training purposes"? Well I used to be the guy monitoring calls for quality and training purposes. I've spent countless hours evaluating people's interactions. So I want to combine my passion for building with my skills in communication to create value for others.</p>
