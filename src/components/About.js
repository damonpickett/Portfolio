      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a Blockchain Developer I am helping to build a world in which
        opportunity transcends borders, both nationally and institutionally. I
        want to make it easy and secure for people all over the world to
        transact, conduct business, and prosper. I bring over a decade’s worth
        of experience in effective communication having worked in various
        customer service roles, including management.

        Up until the 4th quarter of 2021, I worked as a Quality Assurance Lead
        in the Patient Services Department at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.tilray.com/" target="_blank">

        , a licensed producer of medicinal cannabis. Working in a call centre is
        an excellent place to hone one’s communication skills, and this was my
        primary focus for the last 3 years. But I eventually reached a point
        where I felt that if I wanted to continue to grow, I would need a new
        challenge. I also reasoned that while communication skills are
        invaluable, my skill set was missing something.

        While at Tilray I took it upon myself to gather data on the quality of
        our department’s work and to represent that data visually through
        Microsoft Excel. The time I spent building these data visualizations was
        one of the most satisfying work experiences I’ve ever had. The time flew
        by and I often found myself having worked past the end of my shift. This
        was when I started to think about programming.
