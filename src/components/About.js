      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Using React.js I specialize in building intuitive user interfaces. My intention is to make it as easy as possible for people to access the services, products, and information they need when using the internet. Having worked in customer service for over a decade, I am an excellent communicator who knows how to listen as well as convey meaning clearly and concisely. Many of my projects are front-end interfaces that communicate with EVM compatible blockchains. I believe that blockchain technology is the future of e-commerce and will lead to global prosperity.</p>
