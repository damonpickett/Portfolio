      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hi, my name is Damon and I bring over a decadeâ€™s worth of professional experience in customer service, effective communication, and management. As a Blockchain Developer I want to build a world in which opportunity transcends national and institutional borders. I want to make it easy and secure for people all over the world to transact, acquire assets, and prosper. Using React.js and Solidity, I specialize in building user interfaces that interact with smart contracts. I am currently open to new opportunities in the blockchain, web3, and crypto industries.</p>
