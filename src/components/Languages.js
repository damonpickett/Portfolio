        <p>
          As a Blockchain Developer I am helping to build a world in which
          opportunity transcends national and institutional borders. I
          want to make it easy and secure for people all over the world to
          transact, conduct business, and prosper. I bring over a decadeâ€™s worth
          of experience in effective communication having worked in various
          customer service roles, including management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using React.js and Solidity, I specialize in building user interfaces
          which interact with smart contracts.
